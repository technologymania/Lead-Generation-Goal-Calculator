Example Use Case üíº
Imagine you want to generate $100.01 in revenue:
Average Ticket: $10
Conversion Rate: 100%
Calculation:
The formula used is:
Required Leads=Expected RevenueAverage Ticket√ó(Conversion Rate100)\text{Required Leads} = \frac{\text{Expected Revenue}}{\text{Average Ticket} \times \left(\frac{\text{Conversion Rate}}{100}\right)}Required Leads=Average Ticket√ó(100Conversion Rate‚Äã)Expected Revenue‚Äã
Expected Revenue: $100.01
Average Ticket: $10
Conversion Rate: 100%
Required Leads=100.0110√ó(100/100)=10.01 leads\text{Required Leads} = \frac{100.01}{10 \times (100/100)} = 10.01 \text{ leads}Required Leads=10√ó(100/100)100.01‚Äã=10.01 leads
